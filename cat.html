<h2>CAT!</h2>

<p>CAT is a high pressure exam for many, and how to cope is probably a key determinant for cracking this exam. For a lucky few there is no great pressure and this is just another exam to have a go at. If you are one of that brigade, you should probably even skip this article and stay in that carefree bubble. No point thinking and reading about pressure and panic, and planting seeds into the brain.</p>
<br><p>
The Common Admission Test (CAT) is an all-India test conducted by the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) as an entrance exam for admission to the Post-graduate and Fellow Programs in management courses of several management institutes all over India including the IIMs.
The CAT score is used separately by each institute along with other parameters i.e. academic performance, work experience, group discussion, written assessment and interview performance etc. to select candidates. The weightage assigned to CAT score may differ for each institute. Candidates are advised to read the weightage, process and breakup for each institute on its respective website.

<b>How IIMs choose?</b><br>
Some of the IIMs take the CAT score on a percentile basis. This tells us that they see the difference between 99.9th percentile and 98.9th percentile as same as that of between 98.9th percentile and 97.9th percentile. And this is daft. There are few ideas that are more stupid than this.    In one way, they are communicating that they now care far less about their entry processes than they did before. This might not matter that much for the big boys - IIMs A, B and C (though they might lose out to global universities). Because they will continue to get first picks. But this dont-care attitude is still unfathomable.
</p>
<p>
<b>What after CAT?</b><br>
Post CAT, candidates will go through a second round of testing, the most important component of which is the dreaded personal interview. Now is a good time to revisit some aspects of the interview, with particular stress on the key mistakes.</p>
