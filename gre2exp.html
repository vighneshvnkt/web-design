							<strong>1.</strong> With his sub-four minute mile Bannister broke a psychological barrier, and inspired thousands of others to attempt to overcome seemingly ____ hurdles.</p>
							<p>
							A. insurmountable
							<br />B. inane
							<br />C. trivial
							<br />D. traumatic
							<br />E. ineffable
							</p>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong>
                A</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
        <p>If Bannister broke a barrier he did something that others had not done; the hurdle that he overcame would inspire others to overcome barriers that seemed impossible. The word closest to ‘impossible’ is ‘insurmountable’, which literally means ‘cannot be overcome. <br />(Inane – foolish; trivial – unimportant; ineffable – cannot be expressed in words)</p>

<p>
							<strong>2.</strong> Ricks has written extensively not only on the poetry of such (i)____ figures in English poetry as Milton and Housman, but also on the less obviously (ii)____ lyrics of Bob Dylan.</p>
							<p>
							<table><tr>
							<td>Blank (i)<br />
							A. obscurantist 
							<br />B. arcane 
							<br />C. established 
							</td>
							<td>Blank (ii)<br />
							D. canonical 
							<br />E. popular
							<br />F. judicious 
							</td>
							</tr></table>
							</p>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong>
                CD</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
        <p>The clue is in the words ‘less obviously’ which implies that whatever we say about Miton and Housman will apply ‘less obviously’ to Dylan. Hence we are looking for two words of similar meaning. We could say that Milton and Housman are established figures whereas it is less obvious that the poetry of Dylan is ‘established’. If by established we mean accepted as having literary merit, then the partner word is obviously ‘canonical’, which means exactly that. <br />(Arcane – known only to a few; judicious – fair, apt; obscurantist – tending to make things difficult to see)</p>

<p>
							<strong>3.</strong> People who seek advice from (i)____ often find that what they are told can seem true, because these seekers of information attribute significance to some predictions and ignore others. The mind seeks to make sense of predictions that, in themselves, have no (ii)____ value, and thus it becomes difficult to prove that the forecasts are (iii)____ .</p>
							<p>
							<table><tr>
							<td>Blank (i)<br />
							A. experts
							<br />B. philosophers 
							<br />C. clairvoyants
							</td>
							<td>Blank (ii)<br />
							D. special
							<br />E. general 
							<br />F. legal
							</td>
							<td>Blank (iii)<br />
							G. genuine 
							<br />H. specious 
							<br />I. accurate  
							</td>
							</tr></table>
							</p>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong>
                CDH</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
        <p>One of the key words is ‘predictions’ suggesting that we are dealing with fortunetellers or forecasters not philosophers. Next we are told that the mind makes sense of things that have no meaning. Of the choices given, the best word in front of ‘meaning’ is ‘special’. Now we can see that the sentence means that what clairvoyants (people who claim to see the future or to have links with the supernatural) tell people is difficult to prove wrong (specious) because the mind tries to attribute significance to predictions that are not significant (special).</p>

<p>
							<strong>4.</strong> Stress-induced amnesia is a rare and (i)____ phenomenon; it strikes the patient apparently without warning and the memory loss can be as (i)____ as that induced by (iii)____ trauma.</p>
							<p>
							<table><tr>
							<td>Blank (i)<br />
							A. devastating
							<br />B. venial
							<br />C. pervasive
							</td>
							<td>Blank (ii)<br />
							D. generic
							<br />E. limited
							<br />F. complete 
							</td>
							<td>Blank (iii)<br />
							G. unexpected
							<br />H. mental
							<br />I. physical 
							</td>
							</tr></table>
							</p>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong>
                AFI</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
        <p>If the phenomenon is rare it cannot be pervasive (widespread). If we choose ‘devastating’ then we need to fill the second blank with a word that implies very harmful to match ‘devastating’; of the choices, only ‘complete’ works. For the final blank we need a word to contrast with ‘stress-induced’ because we are talking about memory loss (amnesia) caused by stress and comparing it to another type of amnesia. The best choice would be ‘physical’ trauma to contrast with the mental trauma implied in ‘stress-induced’.</p>

<p>
							<strong>5.</strong> The publishers, unwilling to (i)____ the entire risk, insisted that the author pay half the cost of the initial print run of his (ii)____ new book.</p>
							<p>
							<table><tr>
							<td>Blank (i)<br />
							A. hedge
							<br />B. shoulder
							<br />C. mitigate 
							</td>
							<td>Blank (ii)<br />
							D. unexceptionable
							<br />E. controversial
							<br />F. jaundiced 
							</td>
							</tr></table>
							</p>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong>
                BE</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
        <p>The book is obviously a risk to publish and the publishers are unwilling to take all the risk. To ‘shoulder’ the risk means to bear the risk. And the book would be risky if it were ‘controversial’. Be careful to read the choices carefully as ‘unexceptionable’ means ‘cannot be objected to’ and is the opposite of what we need, but some people misunderstand it to mean ‘unacceptable’.</p>

<p>
							<strong>6.</strong> Science advances (i)____ as (ii)____ change abruptly and we are forced to stop and reorient ourselves to view old information in new ways.</p>
							<p>
							<table><tr>
							<td>Blank (i)<br />
							A. exponentially 
							<br />B. inexorably
							<br />C. jerkily 
							</td>
							<td>Blank (ii)<br />
							D. paradigms 
							<br />E. axioms
							<br />F. continuities
							</td>
							</tr></table>
							</p>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong>
                CD</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
        <p>Since the changes are abrupt, the word ‘jerkily’ is best. Since axioms (taken as true) and continuities do not change, we are left with ‘paradigms’ (models, or ways of looking at things).</p>

<p>
							<strong>7.</strong> The game of chess is an example of a ___ information system: the pieces sit inertly on the board until the players move them according to known rules.</p>
							<p>
							A. interactive
							<br />B. passive
							<br />C. cybernetic
							<br />D. disruptive
							<br />E. logistic  
							</p>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong>
                B</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
        <p>The key here is that the pieces are inert or ‘passive’.</p>

<p>
							<strong>8.</strong> A highly intelligent person often thinks (i)____; a few snippets of information can trigger a (ii)____ conclusion that might not stand up to closer, and (iii)____, scrutiny.</p>
							<p>
							<table><tr>
							<td>Blank (i)<br />
							A. too deeply
							<br />B. too warily 
							<br />C. too quickly
							</td>
							<td>Blank (ii)<br />
							D. firm
							<br />E. labored 
							<br />F. hasty 
							</td>
							<td>Blank (iii)<br />
							G. slower
							<br />H. precipitous
							<br />I. overt  
							</td>
							</tr></table>
							</p>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong>
                CFG</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
        <p>If the conclusion might not stand up, it suggests that the conclusion was a bad one. If we select ‘hasty’ for this second blank, then it is easy to see that the thinking was done ‘too quickly’ and that ‘slower’ scrutiny would reveal the error. (Precipitous – hurried; warily – cautiously)</p>


<p>
							<strong>9.</strong> Major philosophical (i)____ about morality, identity and rationality, for example, can often be (ii)____ by thought experiments: short and simple expositions that pose an abstract and complex problem in a concrete manner with all the (iii)____ factors removed.</p>
							<p>
							<table><tr>
							<td>Blank (i)<br />
							A. certitudes
							<br />B. dilemmas
							<br />C. dogmas 
							</td>
							<td>Blank (ii)<br />
							D. mimicked
							<br />E. illuminated 
							<br />F. evoked 
							</td>
							<td>Blank (iii)<br />
							G. extraneous
							<br />H. inherent
							<br />I. pivotal 
							</td>
							</tr></table>
							</p>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong>
                BEG</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
        <p>Since the problems posed are abstract and complex it is unlikely that we would need words like ‘dogma’ and ‘certitudes’ which would imply that the ideas are fixed. However, if we take ‘dilemmas’ (quandaries or difficult choices) then it becomes easy to see that a thought experiment might clarify (illuminate) the dilemma in a simple manner that removed all unnecessary (extraneous) factors. (Pivotal – essential; inherent – inbuilt)</p>



<p>
							<strong>10.</strong> All good comic writers use humor to ____, not to side-step the problems of human behavior.</p>
							<p>
							A. amuse
							<br />B. avert
							<br />C. juxtapose
							<br />D. confront
							<br />E. solve
							</p>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong>
                D</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
        <p>We are looking for the opposite of ‘side-step’ (avoid) and so ‘confront’ is the obvious choice.</p>
