<h2>CAT Test 2 Answers</h2>

<p>SOLUTIONS ARE AS FOLLOWS:<br><br>
1>If w is the average (arithmetic mean) of the numbers a, b, c and d, then the average of m(a + k), m(b + k), m(c + k) and m(d + k) is given by<br>
SOLUTION<br></strong><br>
w is the mean of a, b, c and d is written as<br>
w = (a + b + c + d) / 4<br>
w is the average W of m(a + k), m(b + k), m(c + k) and m(d + k) is given by<br>
W = [ m(a + k) + m(b + k) + m(c + k) + m(d + k) ] / 4<br>
W = m [ a + b + c + d + 4 k] / 4 = m [a + b + c + d ] / 4 + m k<br>
= m (w + k)<br>
If w is the average of a, b, c and d, then the average W of m(a + k), m(b + k), m(c + k) and m(d + k) is given by<br>
W = m (w + k) <br><br></p>

<p>2>A group of 20 employees in a company have an average (arithmetic mean) salary of $35,000 while a second group of 30 employees in the same company have an average salary of $40,000. <br>What is the average salary of the 50 employees making the two groups?<br>
SOLUTION<br></strong><br>
Let S1 be the total salary of the group of 20 employess. Hence<br>
35,000 = S1 / 20<br>
S1 = 20 * 35,000 = $700,000<br>
Let S2 be the total salary of the group of 30 employess. Hence<br>
40,000 = S2 / 30<br>
S2 = $1,200,000<br>
The average of all 50 employers is given by<br>
(700,000 + 1,200,000) / 50 = $38,000 <br><br></p>

<p>3>The sizes of the interior angles A, B and C of a triangle are in the ratio 2:4:3. What is the measure, in degrees, of the smallest angle?<br>
SOLUTION<br></strong><br>
Since the three angles are in the ration 2:4:3, their sizes they may be written in the form<br>
Size of A = 2 k , Size of B = 4 k and size of C = 3 k , where k is a constant.<br>
The sum of the angles of a ny triangle is equal to 180°; hence<br>
2 k + 4 k + 3 k = 180<br>
Solve for k<br>
9 k = 180 , k = 20<br>
The smallest angle is A and its size is equal to 2 k<br>
2 k = 2 × 20 = 40° <br><br></p>



<p>4> If n is even and m is odd, then which of the following is true?<br>
<br>
SOLUTION<br></strong><br>
If n is even, it can be written as follows<br>
n = 2 k , where k is an integer<br>
If m is odd, it can be written as follows<br>
m = 2 K + 1 , where K is an integer<br>
We now express n + m in terms of k and K<br>
n + m = 2 k + 2 K + 1 = 2(k + K) + 1<br>
n + m is odd<br>
We now express n - m in terms of k and K<br>
n - m = 2 k - (2 K + 1) = 2 k - 2 K - 1<br>
n - m = 2 (k - K) - 1<br>
n - m is odd<br>
We now express n * m in terms of k and K<br>
n * m = (2 k)(2 K + 1) = 2( k(2K + 1) )<br>
n * m is even<br>
We now express n2 + m2 + 1 in terms of k and K<br>
n2 + m2 + 1 = (2 k)2 + (2 K + 1)2 + 1 = 4 k2 + 4 K2 + 4 K + 1 + 1<br>
= 2 ( 2 k2 + 2 K2 + 2 K + 1)<br>
n2 + m2 + 1 is even <br><br></p>

<p>5>The sum of all interior angle of a regular polygon is 1800°. How many sides does this polygon have?
<br>
SOLUTION<br></strong><br>
The sum of all interior angles of a polygon of n sides is given by.<br>
(n - 2) * 180<br>
and is equal to 1800°. Hence<br>
(n - 2) * 180 = 1800<br>
Solve for n<br>
(n - 2) = 10<br>
n = 12 <br><br></p>

<p>6> A car covered 130 miles using 4 gallons of diesel. What distance would the same car cover, under similar conditions, on 6.7 gallons?<br>
SOLUTION<br></strong><br>
Solution
<br><br>
The number of miles covered using 1 gallon is given by<br>
(130 / 4) = 32.5 miles/gallon<br>
Using 6.5 gallons, the car will cover<br>
6.7 * 32.5 = 217.75 miles <br><br></p>

<p>7>Which of the following is the largest?<br>
A) 125%<br>
B) 1.25<br>
C) 1 + 1/3<br>
D) 4/3<br>
E) 0.0015/0.001<br>

SOLUTION<br></strong><br>

Convert all given quantities into decimal numbers<br>

A) 125% = 125/100 = 1.25<br>
B) 1.25 = 1.25<br>
C) 1 + 1/3 = 1.333...<br>
D) 4/3 = 1.333...<br>
E) 0.0015/0.001 = 1.5/1 = 1.5<br>

The largest of all given quantities is 0.0015/0.001<br><br></p>

<p>8>In the figure below the sides AB and AC of triangle ABC have equal lengths. Find the size of angle ABC. <br>
<br>
SOLUTION<br></strong><br>
The sum of all three angles in a triangle is equal to 180°. Hence<br>
(4x + 4y) + (x + 3y) + (x + 2y) = 180<br>
Group like terms<br>
6x + 9y = 180<br>
Substitute y by 10 in the eqiuation and solve for x.<br>
6x + 9(10) = 180<br>
6x = 180 - 90 = 90<br>
x = 15<br><br></p>

<p>9>By what percent will the volume of a rectangular solid increase if its length, width and height increase by 25% each?
<br>
SOLUTION<br></strong><br>

Let L, W and H be the length, width and height of the rectangular solid. The volume V is given by<br>
V = L W H<br>
When L, W and H are increased by 25%, they become<br>
L = L + 25%L = L(1 + 25/100) = L(1 + 0.25) = 1.25 L<br>
W = 1.25 W<br>
H = 1.25 H<br>
The volume V2 after the increase is given by<br>
V2 = (1.25 L) (1.25 W) (1.25 H) = 1.253 L W H<br>
Find the percentage P of increase of the volume as follows<br>
P = (V2 - V) / V = (1.253 L W H - L W H) / L W H =<br>
L W H (1.253 - 1) / L W H<br>
= 1.253 - 1 = 0.95 (rounded to the nearest hundreth)<br>
= 95% <br><br></p>

<p>10>What is the average of all prime numbers between 20 and 40?<br>
SOLUTION<br></strong><br>
The prime numbers between 20 and 40 are<br>
23, 29, 31 and 37<br>
Their average is equal to<br>
(23 + 29 + 31 + 37) / 4 = 30 <br>
